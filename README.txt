Project Title: Simhastha 2028 – Smart Crowd Management  
Team ID: TH11672

1. Overview:  
Simhastha 2028 is a next-generation crowd management system tailored for the Mahakumbh Mela in Ujjain. Designed to handle millions of pilgrims, it integrates QR-based registration, real-time analytics, multilingual accessibility, and emergency response tools. The system ensures safety, coordination, and seamless user experience across both pilgrim and administrative interfaces.

2. Problem & Solution  
• Problem Statement:  
Large-scale religious gatherings like Mahakumbh face critical challenges in crowd control, emergency response, and communication. Traditional systems lack scalability, real-time visibility, and inclusive design for diverse user groups.  

• Solution:  
Our prototype introduces a smart, tech-enabled ecosystem that combines drone surveillance, QR tracking, IoT sensors, and AI-powered analytics. It empowers administrators with live dashboards and heatmaps, while providing pilgrims with multilingual registration, safety alerts, and missing person search tools — all accessible through a unified platform.

3. Logic & Workflow  
• Data Collection:  
QR code registration, drone feeds, crowd density sensors, user inputs  

• Processing:  
Real-time data aggregation, facial recognition, heatmap generation, alert triggers via Supabase backend  

• Output:  
Live congestion maps, emergency notifications, search results, dashboard analytics  

• User Side:  
Pilgrim onboarding, QR scanning, multilingual interface, search assistance  

• Admin Side:  
Centralized dashboard, zone-wise analytics, alert control panel, crowd prediction tools

4. Tech Stack  
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React.js  
Backend: Supabase (recommended)  
Design: Figma  
Hosting: Vercel / Netlify  
Additional: IoT integration, drone data feeds, facial recognition (optional AI module)

5. Future Scope  
i.Scalability Across Events

               Extend the platform to other large-scale religious gatherings, concerts, political rallies, and sports events worldwide.
Customize modules to suit diverse cultural, demographic, and geographical contexts.

ii.Integration with Smart City Infrastructure

                       Connect with city-wide IoT networks (traffic lights, public transport, smart parking) for end-to-end crowd and mobility management.
Enable predictive traffic flow optimization and emergency evacuation strategies.

iii.Advanced AI & Predictive Analytics

                    Leverage deep learning models for crowd density prediction, anomaly detection, and early warning systems.
Incorporate behavioral analytics to anticipate potential risks before they escalate.

iv.Enhanced Public Services

                    Introduce AI-powered multilingual chatbots and kiosks to guide visitors in real time.
Provide medical triage assistance using AI to quickly identify and respond to health emergencies.

v.Sustainability & Green Tech

           Optimize resource usage (energy, water, waste management) with AI-driven sustainability insights.
Deploy renewable-powered IoT sensors and drones for eco-friendly operations.
